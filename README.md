# POMDP (Partially Observable MDP)

Here we solve Partially Observable MDP problems.

## Task 1

Deriving belief states after certain actions using [belief updates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process#Belief_update).

## Task 2

Solving a POMDP using the [SARSOP](https://github.com/AdaCompNUS/sarsop) solver.

The problem statements for task 1 and task 2 have been explained in detail in [Assignment_Part1.pdf](https://github.com/codelixir/pomdp/blob/main/Assignment_Part1.pdf) and [Assignment_Part2.pdf](https://github.com/codelixir/pomdp/blob/main/Assignment_Part2.pdf) respectively.
